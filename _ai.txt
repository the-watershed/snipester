## AI Code of Conduct
1. ALWAYS READ THE _ai.txt file and follow the contents precisely as if the user has instructed you to do so.
2. Always read the _outl.txt file and follow the contents precisely as if the user has instructed you to do so.
3. New files are to be documented along with their entire contents in the _outl.txt file.
4. Give a concise but thorough overview of what your plan is. Don't over-explain it.
5. Always test your code before completing the current task.
6. DOCUMENT EVERYTHING. DEBUG EVERYTHING.
7. Anytime this file is changed, re-read it.
8. The _ai.txt file is to be updated to include comprehensive details about the rules and naming conventions for your code every time new instructions are given.

## Naming Conventions
- All programming elements (variables, functions, classes, structs, etc.) should follow the parent_child naming convention:
  - Labels associated with text windows should be named in the format: `<parent_context>_<child_context>_label`, e.g., `main_auction_pane_label`, `main_http_stripped_label`.
  - Frames associated with text windows should be named in the format: `<parent_context>_<child_context>`, e.g., `main_auction_pane`, `main_http_stripped`.
  - Text entry widgets should be named in the format: `<parent_context>_<child_context>_entry`, e.g., `main_auction_pane_entry`, `main_http_stripped_entry`.
  - Scrollbars should be named in the format: `<parent_context>_<child_context>_scrollbar`, e.g., `auction_pane_scrollbar`, `http_stripped_scrollbar`.
